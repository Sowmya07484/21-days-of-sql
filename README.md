# 21 Days of SQL 💻

I’m already familiar with SQL, but I’ve started this 21-day course to stay consistent and refresh the basics!

## 🌱 Day 1 – Introduction & SELECT Statement

### 💡 What I Learnt Today
- SQL stands for Structured Query Language.  
- It is used to store, manage, and retrieve data from databases.  
- SQL lets you create, update, delete, and query data easily.  
- It works with almost all database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.  
- SQL is not case-sensitive — SELECT, select, and Select all mean the same.

### 🔍 SELECT Statement
The SELECT statement is used to fetch data from a database.  
It allows you to retrieve specific columns or all columns from one or more tables.
Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;

## 🌿 Day 2 – WHERE Clause and Operators

### 💡 What I Learnt Today
- Learnt about the WHERE clause and how it helps filter records based on a condition.  
- Understood how to use logical operators like AND and OR to combine multiple conditions.  
- Practiced using comparison operators such as greater than (>), less than (<), and equals (=).  
- Realized how WHERE makes SELECT statements more powerful and precise.  
- The combination of these operators helps narrow down results easily.

Syntax:
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
